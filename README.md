# sqlalchemy-challenge
This was an assignment for the edX Data Visualization Bootcamp affiliated with Case Western Reserve University. This assignment was to practice and employ skills we used in Module 10 - "Advanced SQL". 

In this assignment I created the file MH_Notebook.ipynb (found in the SurfsUp folder) based on the supplied starter code. In that notebook, I used SQLAlchemy to analyze and explore climate data by making queries using the provided hawaii.sqlite file and the provided csv files (found in the Resources folder inside the SurfsUp folder). After making queries, I visualized the results using matplotlib.pyplot.

In the second part of the assignment I designed a Flask API based on the queries done in the python notebook. I created routes and queries in the file app.py (found in the SurfsUp folder of this repo).
